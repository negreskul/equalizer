* NAME: smbPitchShift.cpp
* VERSION: 1.2
* HOME URL: http://blogs.zynaptiq.com/bernsee
* KNOWN BUGS: none
*
* SYNOPSIS: Routine for doing pitch shifting while maintaining
* duration using the Short Time Fourier Transform.
*
* DESCRIPTION: The routine takes a pitchShift factor value which is between 0.5
* (one octave down) and 2. (one octave up). A value of exactly 1 does not change
* the pitch. numSampsToProcess tells the routine how many samples in indata[0...
* numSampsToProcess-1] should be pitch shifted and moved to outdata[0 ...
* numSampsToProcess-1]. The two buffers can be identical (ie. it can process the
* data in-place). fftFrameSize defines the FFT frame size used for the
* processing. Typical values are 1024, 2048 and 4096. It may be any value <=
* MAX_FRAME_LENGTH but it MUST be a power of 2. osamp is the STFT
* oversampling factor which also determines the overlap between adjacent STFT
* frames. It should at least be 4 for moderate scaling ratios. A value of 32 is
* recommended for best quality. sampleRate takes the sample rate for the signal
* in unit Hz, ie. 44100 for 44.1 kHz audio. The data passed to the routine in
* indata[] should be in the range [-1.0, 1.0), which is also the output range
* for the data, make sure you scale the data accordingly (for 16bit signed integers
* you would have to divide (and multiply) by 32768).
